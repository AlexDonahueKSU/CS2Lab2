## Alex Donahue lab 2

Program that involves involves the testing of a Class called Time. The only real objective is to ensure
that the tests are passing and that all the functionality is adequate. Only 3 commands are really
important to use the program.

- Make
You need to ensure that make is installed on your machine, but if it is this will show you all
the different tests being ran.

- Make Tests
This ensures that the functionality is actually working, if a test fails, there's obviously something off.

- Make Clean
This cleans up all the executables that the tests make.
